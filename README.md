The jar application file generates the graph of Instantaneous piston speed relative to average piston speed vs crank angle for a given value of R(r/a), where r- connecting rod length, a - crankshaft offet, of an IC engine. 
Working on updating the application to calculate cylinder bore, average piston speed, clearance volume, brake power, indicated power, break mean effective pressure, indicated mean effective pressure, friction mean effective pressure.
